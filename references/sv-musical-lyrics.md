## Attention is all you need

Attention is all you need
but don’t come crawling back here
To get it from me 

Validation, oh that’s what you seek
Your lies can’t generalize 
And you overfit to me 

I can feel some hesitation
How you train me then test me 
Oh you never had the patience
I need one shot
To make you want me
Before you leave with someone new
Is she state of the art

I feel in tune with you
That’s the state of my heart
You finish sentences I say
As soon as I start

No one knows me better
Oh letter for letter
But you talk in generalities
Hallucinate reality

Attention is all you need
but don’t come crawling back here
To get it from me 


Validation, oh that’s what you seek
Your lies can’t generalize 
And you overfit to me


##  S.F. State of Mind

Oh the hills of San francisco
Fog is rolling so deep
on an incline so steep
Green fields are on the mind
Gold seekers magnetized
For some, they’ll never wait
They work hard and pray

  
Oh the hills of San francisco
Fog is rolling so deep
on an incline too steep
In a rush some fall behind
All have money on their minds
Below they hide in wait
They bide their time to prey

The ephemeral weather is giving me shivers
mile by mile, hour by hour
Infinite reminders
Of the world, she plays
People sleep on streets outside
Victorians with silk sheets
Everybody’s working begging
using, playing, needing
it’s so fleeting

Oh the hills of San francisco
Fog is rolling so deep
on an incline so steep
Green fields are on the mind
Gold seekers magnetized
For some, they’ll never wait
They work hard and pray

The schizophrenic weather makes me feel untethered
block to block, day to day
from the mission to east bay
there’s a chasm at play
People sleep on streets outside
Victorians with silk sheets
Everybody’s working begging
using, playing, needing
it’s so fleeting

Oh the hills of San francisco
Fog is rolling so deep
on an incline too steep
In a rush some fall behind
All have money on their minds
We look out to the bay
We had everything but time


Because that’s what happens 
Under a torn open sky
In a city borrowed from the sea
