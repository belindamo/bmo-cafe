"C4. An anti-Pascal pyramid is a finite set of numbers, placed in a triangle-shaped array so that the first row of the array contains one number, the second row contains two numbers, the third row contains three numbers and so on; and, except for the numbers in the bottom row, each number equals the absolute value of the difference of the two numbers below it. For instance, the triangle below is an anti-Pascal pyramid with four rows, in which every integer from 1 to $1+2+3+4=10$ occurs exactly once:

$$
\begin{array}{cccc} 
& & 4 \\
& 2 & 6 \\
& 5 & 7 & 1 \\
8 & 3 & 10 & 9

"C7. There are 60 empty boxes $B_{1}, \ldots, B_{60}$ in a row on a table and an unlimited supply of pebbles. Given a positive integer $n$, Alice and Bob play the following game.

In the first round, Alice takes $n$ pebbles and distributes them into the 60 boxes as she wishes. Each subsequent round consists of two steps:

(a) Bob chooses an integer $k$ with $1 \leqslant k \leqslant 59$ and splits the boxes into the two groups $B_{1}, \ldots, B_{k}$ and $B_{k+1}, \ldots, B_{60}$.

(b) Alice picks one of these two groups, adds one pebble to each box in that group, and removes one pebble from each box in the other group.

Bob wins if, at the end of any round, some box contains no pebbles. Find the smallest $n$ such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning.

"A5. A magician intends to perform the following trick. She announces a positive integer $n$, along with $2 n$ real numbers $x_{1}<\ldots<x_{2 n}$, to the audience. A member of the audience then secretly chooses a polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $n$ with real coefficients, computes the $2 n$ values $P\left(x_{1}\right), \ldots, P\left(x_{2 n}\right)$, and writes down these $2 n$ values on the blackboard in non-decreasing order.

"C8. Players $A$ and $B$ play a game on a blackboard that initially contains 2020 copies of the number 1. In every round, player $A$ erases two numbers $x$ and $y$ from the blackboard, and then player $B$ writes one of the numbers $x+y$ and $|x-y|$ on the blackboard. The game terminates as soon as, at the end of some round, one of the following holds:

(1) one of the numbers on the blackboard is larger than the sum of all other numbers;

(2) there are only zeros on the blackboard.

Player $B$ must then give as many cookies to player $A$ as there are numbers on the blackboard. Player $A$ wants to get as many cookies as possible, whereas player $B$ wants to give as few as possible. Determine the number of cookies that $A$ receives if both players play optimally.",7
